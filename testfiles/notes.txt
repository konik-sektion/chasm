 chasm sections:
 - #section macros  (for macros)
 - #section data    (for program data, like vars)
 - #section program (the program itself)
 notes:
  - functions are defined either global or local as: `<local/global> func func_name(<args>):` and are terminated with `end`.
    --> global functions (when defined in the highest scope) are accessible from other files or by other processes, and are
        accesible even before they are defined.   
    --> global functions (when defined in any other scope, e.g. in another function) are still accessible by other files or
        processes, but can only be called within their scope. They can still be called before definition in their scope.
    --> local functions are the opposite of globals in most ways that should be self-explanatory.
    --> inline functions work similarly to c/c++ inlines, but inlines are not suggestions to ChASM. ChASM's assembler will
        always enforce `inline`, so make sure you use it correctly!

# Getting Started with ChASM

Want to use ChASM? Giddy to use ChASM? Well then, figure out how to install it,
it's pretty easy, and then use the `.chasm` file extension for ChASM files and the
`.ravine` file extension for ChASM header files.

| Extension | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `.chasm` | ChASM file |
| `.ravine` | ChASM header |
| `.csm` | ChASM file shorthand |
| `.rvn` | ChASM header shorthand |
